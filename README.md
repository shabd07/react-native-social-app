# React-Native-Basic-App

## About
Given the era shifting towards e-commerce, individuals may find themselves in a position where they need to design a mobile app for **both** iOS and Android devices for their start-up purposes. Rather than outsourcing this job, it is this project's aim to ease this process to a level where new coders are able to build an app for both platforms, while not easily but with sufficient effort invested. This is done by dividing the numerous features of an app into pieces for users to **implement one at a time**, and **integrate together** at a **manageable pace** so that users will be have an easier time understanding the process of building a mobile app.

## Why React Native?
React Native is a programming framework developed by Facebook to facilitate **cross-platform** mobile app development. Simply put, despite the difference in programming language across both iOS and Android devices, React Native **unifies** them by allowing you to code in one language and building it by reinterpreting it for both devices. 

Furthermore, the language used is JavaScript, a language that is simple to pick up and most commonly known to people. Having knowledge of JavaScript through this project also does ease the learning of web development a bunch simpler too, given that a React Native is a branch from React that is used for web app development. 

## What you can expect
Rather than being a novel, standalone library, this project is loaded with various modules listed under 'Features' which are relevant in the process of making a social app. To support the user, **each and every component** of the example app coded up will have (hopefully) sufficient comments as well as references to the simple implementation of it. While this project is focused towards a Tinder app, the manner in which modules are implemented can be adapted to suit purposes up to the individual's creativity. Or it can give a sense to new coders on what has to go on at the back-end to achieve what users see in their mobile apps. 

## Features you will learn to implement
> For the most part of these features, installation can be done by a simple npm install.

## Usage
> Important note: after downloading the project, remember to clean the project and rebuild/recompile to run successfully.
1. Head [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) to get started with the installation process of various dependencies
2. Decide on a code editor, such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3). Install a [linter](https://eslint.org/) for your code editor to help with getting your syntax right
3. You can proceed in either of the two directions
  * As each part is fully runnable/buildable, you can download individual parts and explore the app from there
  * OR you can initialise your own project and install the required new modules, create the additional files required, copy the new chunks of code one by one to see their effect take place step by step and stack over one another (**HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**)
4. In the latter's case, a README file will be attached to each part to inform you on the newly added features, blocks of codes, modules installed as well as the order in which you perform those tasks.
5. Last by not least, feel free to post an issue upon encountering a bug/mistake or any queries!
